5. occasions table: "contains user assigned occasions of events or holidays that a recipe is best used for"


Relationships

    One-to-One
        Occasion to recipe: a recipe can have an occasion
    One-to-Many
        Users to Recipe: one user can have many recipes but a recipe cannot have many Users
    Many-to-Many:
        Recipe to Ratings to Users: a recipe can have many ratings and comments, and a user can have many ratings and comments on recipes
        Grocery Table to Users to Recipes: Users can have grocery lists that contain recipes and can be viewed by other Users
